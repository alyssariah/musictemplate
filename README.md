## Alyssa Music Studio 

This project is a web application to advertise music lessons to the public from a private music studio. It includes 6 navigaton links: Home, About, Lessons, Policies, Perform, and Contact. 

## Motivation

My goal is to provide small businesses or individuals with a professsional website and enhanced internet presence. This website is am example of what I can do with a small business such as a music studio. 

## Build Status

Build status of continus integration through Travis CI

## Code Style

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Screenshots


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
